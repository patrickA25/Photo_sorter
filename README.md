# Photo Sorter

## Overview
Photo Sorter is a simple Python script that helps organize files in a directory by sorting them into subfolders based on their file extension. This tool is especially useful for managing large directories, making them easier to navigate and maintain.

## Features
- **Automated Sorting:** Automatically sorts files into appropriately named subfolders based on their file extension.
- **Easy to Use:** Run the script from the terminalâ€”no complex setup required.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Setup
1. Clone this repository or download the script directly:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/photo-sorter.git

## Usage
To use Photo Sorter, you will need to run the script from the terminal and specify the path to the directory
containing the files you want to sort. Here is the command format. 

```bash
python photo_sorter.py /path/to/your/directory
```
Replace `/path/to/your/directory` with the actual path to the directory where your files are located.
